## 🔬 Deep Research Agent - Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Add autonomous deep research capabilities to Chat module
**Based on:** GPT Researcher architecture (adapted to Go)
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Priority:** HIGH

### Phase 1: Research Agent Core (Week 1)

#### Backend - New Agent Type
- [ ] Create `AgentTypeV2Research` in agent registry
- [ ] Implement `ResearchAgent` struct with interface
- [ ] Add research-specific system prompt
- [ ] Integrate with existing AgentV2 interface

#### Research Planner Service
- [ ] Create `internal/services/research_planner.go`
- [ ] Implement question generation from user query
- [ ] Sub-query expansion logic
- [ ] Research scope determination

#### Research Executor Service
- [ ] Create `internal/services/research_executor.go`
- [ ] Parallel search execution per sub-question
- [ ] Source ranking and filtering
- [ ] Citation extraction and tracking

#### Research Aggregator Service
- [ ] Create `internal/services/research_aggregator.go`
- [ ] Information synthesis
- [ ] Duplicate removal
- [ ] Relevance scoring

#### Database Schema
- [ ] Create migration `035_research_system.sql`
- [ ] Tables:
  - `research_tasks` (id, user_id, workspace_id, query, status, created_at)
  - `research_queries` (id, task_id, question, search_results, completed)
  - `research_sources` (id, task_id, url, title, content, relevance_score, cited)
  - `research_reports` (id, task_id, content, format, citations, word_count)

### Phase 2: Integration with Existing Systems (Week 2)

#### COT Orchestration Integration
- [ ] Add ResearchAgent to OrchestratorCOT
- [ ] Implement research workflow in COT
- [ ] Multi-step thinking for research process
- [ ] Progress streaming via thinking events

#### RAG Integration
- [ ] Connect ResearchExecutor with HybridSearchService
- [ ] Use existing embedding service for semantic search
- [ ] Leverage document RAG for local research
- [ ] Implement query expansion with existing service

#### Memory Integration
- [ ] Inject workspace memories into research context
- [ ] Save research results as workspace memories
- [ ] Link research to projects/contexts
- [ ] Enable research memory retrieval

#### Focus Mode Enhancement
- [ ] Add `research` focus mode
- [ ] Configure LLM settings for research
- [ ] Enable web search by default
- [ ] Set research-specific output style

### Phase 3: Frontend & UX (Week 2-3)

#### Chat UI Updates
- [ ] Add `/research` slash command
- [ ] Research mode indicator in UI
- [ ] Progress visualization (sub-questions)
- [ ] Source list display with citations

#### Artifact System Enhancement
- [ ] Detect research reports as artifacts
- [ ] Add `research_report` artifact type
- [ ] Citation panel in artifact viewer
- [ ] Export to PDF/Markdown

#### Research Dashboard (Optional)
- [ ] New route: `/research`
- [ ] List all research tasks
- [ ] View research history
- [ ] Re-run/refine research

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 3)

#### Multi-Source Search
- [ ] Web search integration (Tavily/SerpAPI)
- [ ] Local document search (existing RAG)
- [ ] Workspace memory search
- [ ] arXiv integration (via MCP)

#### Report Generation
- [ ] Structured report templates
- [ ] Multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, Docx)
- [ ] Citation formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago)
- [ ] Executive summary generation

#### Cost & Performance Tracking
- [ ] Track LLM tokens per research task
- [ ] Measure search API costs
- [ ] Research duration metrics
- [ ] Quality scoring (user feedback)

#### Collaborative Research (Future)
- [ ] Team research tasks
- [ ] Shared research workspace
- [ ] Comment on sources
- [ ] Research versioning

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] User can type `/research [topic]` and get comprehensive report
- [ ] Report includes 5+ diverse sources with citations
- [ ] Research completes in < 3 minutes
- [ ] Cost < $0.01 per research task
- [ ] All sources are ranked by relevance
- [ ] Reports saved as artifacts
- [ ] Integration with existing Chat UX (seamless)
