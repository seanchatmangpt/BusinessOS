## ⚙️ Feature 3: Background Jobs System

### What It Does
Production-ready asynchronous task processing enabling reliable execution of long-running operations, scheduled tasks, and background workflows.

### Key Components

**Backend:**
- `migrations/036_background_jobs.sql` (194 lines) - Tables: `background_jobs`, `scheduled_jobs`

- `handlers/custom_job_handlers.go` (431 lines) - Job handler registration

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- background_jobs table (13 columns)
- Priority-based queue
- Atomic job locking (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Worker crash recovery via lock expiry
- JSONB payload and result storage

-- scheduled_jobs table
- Cron expression support
- Timezone-aware scheduling
- Active/inactive toggle
- Last run and next run tracking
```

**API Endpoints (11 new):**
```

POST   /api/jobs/:id/retry          - Retry failed job
DELETE /api/jobs/:id                - Delete job

POST   /api/scheduled-jobs          - Create scheduled job
GET    /api/scheduled-jobs/:id      - Get scheduled job
GET    /api/scheduled-jobs          - List scheduled jobs
PUT    /api/scheduled-jobs/:id      - Update scheduled job

GET    /api/jobs/stats              - Job statistics
POST   /api/jobs/cleanup            - Cleanup old jobs
```

**Built-in Job Handlers:**
- `email_send` - Send emails via SMTP/SendGrid
- `report_generate` - Generate PDF/Excel reports

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Custom Agents @Mention Autocomplete

### Issue
Custom agents were invisible in the @mention autocomplete dropdown. Only built-in agents (document, project, task, etc.) appeared.

### Root Cause
Two separate agent lists:
- `availableAgents[]` - Used for @mention autocomplete (only had built-in agents)
- `customAgents[]` - Custom agents loaded separately but never merged

### Fix
**File:** `frontend/src/routes/(app)/chat/+page.svelte`

**Changes:**
1. Convert custom agents to `AgentPreset` format
2. Merge custom agents into `availableAgents[]` array
3. Load agents sequentially (`await`) to ensure proper order
4. Filter duplicates before appending

**Result:**
```javascript
[Chat] Loaded 10 agent presets
[Chat] Loaded 1 custom agents
[Chat] Total available agents for @mention: 11 ( 1 custom, 10 built-in) ✅
```

Custom agents now appear in @mention dropdown and work correctly!

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend
```bash
cd desktop/backend-go
go build -o bin/server.exe ./cmd/server  # ✅ SUCCESS
sqlc generate                             # ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run check   # ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
npm test        # ✅ 63 tests passing
npm run build   # ✅ Build successful
```

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Custom agent creation flow
- ✅ Custom agent @mention autocomplete
- ✅ Thinking panel visualization
- ✅ Background job enqueue → execution
- ✅ Scheduled job cron triggering
- ✅ SSE streaming for agents and thinking

---

## 🔒 Security

### Input Validation
- Agent name: 1-100 characters (DB constraint)
- System prompt: max 5000 characters
- Temperature: 0.0-2.0 with precision validation
- SQLC parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)

### Authorization
- All queries scoped to user: `WHERE user_id = $1`
- Agents private by default (`is_public = FALSE`)
- Explicit opt-in for sharing

### Background Jobs
- Rate limiting per user
- Payload validation prevents code injection
- Job ownership enforcement
